# ScoreBoard application.
The application shows a player name, their scores, total number of players, total points by all players and a timer.
Most of it is inspired by a course by @jimrhoskins of Airbnb from treehouse.

## How to run it?
Just open the file **index.html** using your favourite browser.

## Some of its functionality.
* Add a player to the scoreboard.
* Increase or reduce the players points
* Remove a player from the scoreboard.
* View total number of players added.
* View total number of all the points of the added players.
* A stop watch.

## Here is how it looks like.
